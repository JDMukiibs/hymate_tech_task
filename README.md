## üìù Small Description of the Implementation

This section provides a high-level overview of how the application is structured and key technical decisions.

* **Architecture:** Briefly describe the architectural pattern used (e.g., MVVM, BLoC, Provider, Riverpod, simple stateful widgets).
* **Key Features Implemented:**
    * [List major features, e.g., "Chart visualization for energy data"]
    * [e.g., "Dynamic data loading and rendering"]
    * [e.g., "Responsive UI for desktop and web"]
* **Core Libraries/Packages:**
    * `package_name_1`: [Briefly describe its use]
    * `package_name_2`: [Briefly describe its use]
* **Data Handling:** [How is data fetched, parsed, and managed? e.g., "Uses a mock API service for data fetching."]

## üí° Notes about Assumptions, Limitations, or Extra Work Done

* **Assumptions:**
    * [e.g., "Assumed data would be available in a specific JSON format."]
    * [e.g., "Assumed the target environment would be desktop/web, prioritizing responsive layout over mobile-specific gestures."]
* **Limitations:**
    * [e.g., "Currently, data refresh is manual; no real-time updates implemented."]
    * [e.g., "Error handling is basic for network requests."]
    * [e.g., "No extensive unit/integration tests are included due to time constraints."]
* **Extra Work Done:**
    * [e.g., "Implemented a custom theme to match a specific brand guide."]
    * [e.g., "Created a reusable chart component that can be easily extended."]
    * [e.g., "Designed a custom 404 error page (referencing the one we made earlier!)."]
